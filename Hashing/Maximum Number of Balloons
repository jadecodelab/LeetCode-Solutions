# Given a string text, you want to use the characters of text to form as many instances of the word "balloon" as possible.
# You can use each character in text at most once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

class Solution:
    def maxNumberOfBalloons(self, text: str) -> int:
        # initialize an empty dictionary to store the letters and its freqency
        letter_dict = {}
        for letter in text:
            letter_dict[letter] = letter_dict.get(letter,0)+1
            
        text = {'b':1,'a':1,'l':2,'o':2,'n':1}
        return min(letter_dict.get(letter,0)//text[letter] for letter in text)

# O(n) time and O(1) space
