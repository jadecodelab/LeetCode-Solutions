# Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed 
# by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.
# Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        # check for obvious fail case
        if len(ransomNote) > len(magazine):
            return False
        
        # use Counter class 
        letters = collections.Counter(magazine)
        
        for c in ransomNote:
            if letters[c] <= 0:
                return False
            letters[c] -= 1
        
        return True


# m is the length of the magazine
# Time Complexity : O(m)
# Space Complexity : O(1)
